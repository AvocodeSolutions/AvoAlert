# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a real-time crypto signal platform that delivers UT Bot indicator-based trading signals to users via email, SMS, and web push notifications. The platform targets crypto traders who need trading signals but don't want to deal with technical setups. The system will handle TradingView webhook integrations, user management, subscription billing, and multi-channel notifications while maintaining high reliability and security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure UT Bot parameters for different coin-timeframe combinations, so that I can manage trading signal configurations centrally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display a configuration interface for UT Bot parameters
2. WHEN an administrator enters coin symbol, timeframe, EMA, ATR, and Multiplier values THEN the system SHALL validate and store these parameters
3. WHEN parameters are saved THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding Pine Script code and webhook URL
4. IF invalid parameters are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent saving
5. WHEN parameters are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for audit purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to monitor system performance and queue status, so that I can ensure the platform operates reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time queue metrics
2. WHEN signal processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and alert administrators
3. WHEN system load exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger automated alerts
4. IF services become unavailable THEN the system SHALL display service status indicators
5. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show signal delivery rates, user activity, and system performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a crypto trader, I want to receive trading signals via my preferred notification method, so that I can act on trading opportunities quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TradingView alarm triggers THEN the system SHALL process the webhook payload within 5 seconds
2. WHEN a valid signal is received THEN the system SHALL identify matching active user alarms
3. WHEN a user has sufficient credits THEN the system SHALL send notifications via their selected channels
4. IF a user has insufficient credits THEN the system SHALL skip notification and log the event
5. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status and update user credit balance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a crypto trader, I want to manage my alarm subscriptions and view my notification history, so that I can control my trading signal preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the web client THEN the system SHALL display their active alarms and account status
2. WHEN a user creates a new alarm THEN the system SHALL validate their subscription limits and save the configuration
3. WHEN a user modifies alarm settings THEN the system SHALL update the configuration immediately
4. IF a user exceeds their plan limits THEN the system SHALL prevent alarm creation and suggest plan upgrade
5. WHEN viewing notification history THEN the system SHALL display past signals with timestamps and delivery status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a crypto trader, I want to purchase credits or subscription plans, so that I can receive trading signals according to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a subscription plan THEN the system SHALL redirect to Stripe Checkout
2. WHEN payment is completed THEN the system SHALL update user credits and plan status via webhook
3. WHEN subscription expires THEN the system SHALL disable signal delivery and notify the user
4. IF payment fails THEN the system SHALL maintain current service level until grace period expires
5. WHEN viewing billing history THEN the system SHALL display all transactions and current plan details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system component, I want to authenticate API requests securely, so that only authorized users can access platform features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the Supabase JWT token
2. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized response
3. WHEN token is valid THEN the system SHALL extract user identity and proceed with request
4. IF rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 Too Many Requests response
5. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions and subscription status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the system to handle high signal volumes reliably, so that users receive timely notifications during market volatility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signal volume increases THEN the system SHALL process webhooks without blocking
2. WHEN queue depth exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL scale processing capacity
3. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL implement fallback mechanisms
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN system recovers from failures THEN the system SHALL process queued signals in order

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want user data to be handled according to GDPR/KVKK regulations, so that the platform meets legal requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL obtain explicit consent for data processing
2. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all personal information within 30 days
3. WHEN logging system events THEN the system SHALL redact sensitive information
4. IF data breach occurs THEN the system SHALL have incident response procedures in place
5. WHEN users access their data THEN the system SHALL provide complete data export functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to be available 24/7, so that I don't miss important trading signals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.5% uptime
2. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL schedule during low-traffic periods
3. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL automatically restart failed components
4. IF database becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue operations until recovery
5. WHEN system load balancing is needed THEN the system SHALL distribute traffic across healthy instances

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log structured data with appropriate levels
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track response times, error rates, and throughput
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL notify operations team via configured channels
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics information
5. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL retain metrics data for at least 90 days
